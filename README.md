# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze the overall passing rate of students in Py City High Schools categorized by the type of school and their spending per student. 

## Results

After an initial analysis of the schools' passing rates, it was found that there was some cheating in the 9th grade class of Thomas High School. As a result, their reading and math scores were removed from the data. This resulted in the following changes to the analysis: 

- After removing the 9th grade scores, Thomas High School still ranks as the second highest performing school in the district as their Overall Passing Percentage only lowered from 90.95 to 90.63 as a result of high passing scores in the upperclass grades. 
- When creating a table to compare average scores of both reading and math across the high schools, only the Thomas High School returns a NaN in the 9th grade column. Otherwise, it can be seen that the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders skew to the higher end of average scores in the mid 80's, while many other schools have average scores in the 70's or low 80's. These numbers correlate with the high number of students passing as seen in the above bullet.

Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four major changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
